# C? Programming Language

## Authors
Andrew Aday, Amol Kapoor, Jonathan Zhang

## Installation
In order to make the language, you need to install the Eigen source. Get the tarball [here](http://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/3.3.4.tar.bz2). Extract the contents and rename the generated folder to `cqm/eigen`.

Alternatively run the `get_eigen.sh` script.

## Abstract
In this repository we present C?, a multi-paradigm imperative general purpose language. C? is designed to provide a foundation for domain specific applications through the development of powerful yet simple libraries. Input to the C? compiler mimics the familiar C coding syntax. The compiler outputs an C? executable, using LLVM as an intermediate state. We demonstrate the flexibility of C? by providing and explaining a simple Deep Learning library, C? DEEP. This module contains the essential components that allow users to quickly and flexibly develop neural networks models in C?.
