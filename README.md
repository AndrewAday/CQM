## Abstract
In this repository we present C?, a multi-paradigm imperative general purpose language. C? is designed to provide a foundation for domain specific applications through the development of powerful yet simple libraries. Input to the C? compiler mimics the familiar C coding syntax. The compiler outputs an C? executable, using LLVM as an intermediate state. We demonstrate the flexibility of C? by providing and explaining a simple Deep Learning library, C? DEEP. This module contains the essential components that allow users to quickly and flexibly develop neural networks models in C?.
